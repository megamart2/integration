CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION (0.2.6):
--------------------------------------

- Bug fixes.

CHANGES FROM VERSION (0.2.5):
-----------------------------

- Added new tracing utility 'tracer' that can be used to parse aspect-monitor
  log files (tracer -h for usage info)
- Monitored programs now automatically create a run log (spoon/runlog) when run,
  this file can then be parsed using the aforementioned tracer.
- Added a regexp optimizer for aspect monitor, making the generated code much
  cleaner and for more complicated regular expressions.
- Also several bug fixes.

CHANGES FROM VERSION (0.2.4):
-----------------------------

- This is mostly just a bug fix realease, next version with LCT and preliminary
  tracing utilities is going to be released soon after we manage to integrate
  the tools properly.

  release.
- Several bug fixes.

CHANGES FROM VERSION (0.2.3):
-----------------------------

- Added a simple graphical user interface that can be launched with the
  'limegui' script.
- 'beautify.py' can now be used to clean up exception traces when a
  specification is broken. (usage: java <class> 2>&1 | beautify.py)
- Moved all the scripts to 'bin' directory under limt root.
- 'bin' directory also has a precompiled scheck2 available, if that doesn't
  work, sources for compiling a new copy are still provided under
  'dependencies'.
- Several bug fixes.


CHANGES FROM VERSION (0.2.2):
-----------------------------

- Fixed most of "advice did not match" warnings (LIMET-1).
- A mere warning is now output instead of error if the package names begin with
  an uppercase letter, which seems to sometimes cause problems in the weaving or
  compilation process.
- Bumped all tool version numbers up to sync with monitoring toolkit for easier
  maintenance.

CHANGES FROM VERSION (0.2.1):
-----------------------------

- Made a small fix to the limejava and limejc scripts so that they don't bug out
  when used with classpath script anymore.
- Fixed a bug with certain specifications resulting in duplicate variable names
  (LIMET-2).
- Fixed an "affected type not exposed to the weaver" warning that happened often
  when using the tools (LIMET-4).
- Package names should begin with a lowercase letter, and the user is now
  reminded about this if they don't.
