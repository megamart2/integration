TOOLS:

lcf2smt2:
	reads a constraint in LCF into stdin and writes an equivalent SMTLIB 2.0
	instance into stdout. Hasn't been tested completely yet so some things might
	not work as expected (especially boolean constants 'true' and 'false')
z3backend:
	a backend written for z3 that parses the solver output and outputs either
	'unsat' or a set of values for the input variables in order (input_1 input_2
	and so on)

TODO:

- make sure lcf2smt2 correctly handles all constraints
- write a backend for boolector when it is usable (when it supports SMTLIB 2.0)
- make LCT use these tools.

USAGE:

the tools can be used in following manner (requires the z3 binary):
	lcf2smt2 | z3 -smt2 -in -m | z3backend

LCF:

S -> C | C 'D' S
C -> OP V E
E -> V | OP V V
OP -> '==' | '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>=' | ...
V -> 'i' <int> '_' <name> | 'u' <int> '_' <name> | 
     'b' '_' <name> | 'O' '_' <name> | <const>
