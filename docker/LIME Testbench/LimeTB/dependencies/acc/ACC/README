The following description assumes a Linux environment and a
sufficiently recent installation of gcc (version 2.9 or above).

Build and Test
==================

  1. `cd' to the directory containing ACC's source code, ie. "cd ACC/".
  
  2. make
     ...
     result:                         <--- build is successful and all test cases pass
     total=96, succeed = 96 , fail = 0

  The ACC compiler resides in the bin directory with name "acc".

Compilers and Options
=====================

The following special build targets are supported:

  * `build' only builds the ACC compiler.
    
  * `test'  only runs the test cases, assuming ACC compiler is already built.
  
  * `clean' removes the ACC compiler and bin directory created when running the test cases.

runTest Script
====================

Optionally, you could run individual or all test cases by using runTest script under ACC/test directory, like :

   1. `cd' to the directory containing all test cases.

   2. ./runTest case01 case02

    or
      ./runTest case*


If the ACC compiler is not in the default directory, set ACCTEST to point
to the ACC compiler before running the runTest script as following:

   1. ACCTEST=~/myacc/acc

   2. export ACCTEST

   3. ./runTest case*
