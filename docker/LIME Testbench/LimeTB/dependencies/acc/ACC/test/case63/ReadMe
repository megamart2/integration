test :
 1. revised gcc attribute support.
 2. __builtin_offsetof support.
 3. support empty initializer brace.

ACC compiler should be able to parse source files.

   add a test case for a user reported gcc attribute use.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your fix. Unfortunately, that problem didn't go away
completely. I place a case for you.

----
typedef struct {
  int (__attribute__((cdecl)) *convert)(void *data, const char *s); /*
ACC error*/
  void (__attribute__((cdecl)) *release)(void *data); /* ACC error */
} XML_Encoding;

One more test case. Our application has the following code fragement.
ACC does not like this. You can see the error in the comment.

---
typedef struct X
{
    const char **paramNames_apvc;
} X_t;

X_t X_a[ 1 ] = {
    
    {
      .paramNames_apvc    = (const char  *[0]) { 
       } /* ACC error */
    }
};
---
