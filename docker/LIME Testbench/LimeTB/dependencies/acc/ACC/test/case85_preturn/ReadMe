feature work:
	preturn() support, allow advice code return immediately out of the parent function.

July 22, 2007
	add case for preturn() enhancement: preturn() can return any value, not only non-zero-integer.

	when preturn() takes a floating value, it is converted to an integer value first. Therefore, its original value is not preserved.

	This might be fixed in the future.
