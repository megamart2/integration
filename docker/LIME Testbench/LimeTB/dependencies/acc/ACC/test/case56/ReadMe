test bug fix:
	1. handle the case when a parameter is declared as an array
	2. handle the case:
		int * a;
		sizeof a;
		sizeof *a;
	3. the introduce() advice should also insert type member into the type definition inside the aspect file, ie.
		struct X {
			int a;
		};

		introduce(): intype(struct X) {
			int b;
		}

		shoud work.
