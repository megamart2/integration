How to compile the solver libraries
===================================

You need to first download either Yices or Boolector. See the user guide for 
the web addresses of these tools.

First modify the Makefile to set the paths to Java, Yices and Boolector so that 
they correspond to the paths in your system. After that, the library for Yices 
can be compiled with command "make yices" and Boolector with command 
"make boolector". If you are planning on using only one of the supported 
solvers, it is not necessary to download and compile the other one. 

In case the compilation of boolector library succeeds but the LCT displays an
"undefined reference to `__stack_chk_fail'" error when running tests, you
can try to add -fstack-protector flag to the boolector gcc line in the Makefile.

The boolector library and picosat must be compiled with -fPIC, as they will be
included in a shared object. The 1.4 source release of boolector does not have
this as a default.

The boolector library's header file btormem.h contains a function prototype:

void *btor_realloc (BtorMemMgr * mm, void *, size_t old, size_t new);

, which must be changed to:

void *btor_realloc (BtorMemMgr * mm, void *, size_t old, size_t new_size);

, or equivalent. Otherwise the c++ jni source file that includes it will not
compile (because of the "new").
