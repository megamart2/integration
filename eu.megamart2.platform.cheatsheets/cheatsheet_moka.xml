      <description>
         A UML model can be executed using Moka. Create a Moka execution configuration as described in the Moka Documentation: 
         <br/><b>https://wiki.eclipse.org/Papyrus/UserGuide/ModelExecution#Getting_started_with_Moka</b>
         <br/>Launch the Moka configuration for the UML model. The execution will be shown graphically in the Papyrus UML editor. 
         <br/>Simultaneously, execution logs will be displayed in two views: * The fUML console view. * The new Moka execution view.
         <br/>In the execution view log entries are describing the inflows and outflows in/from any behavioral actions of the model, 
         including information about the action, its inputs and outputs at the moment of the logging. 
         <br/>Selecting any log entry with a double click opens a detail windows that renders the log information Log entries are populated in the temporal order they are provided, 
         which corresponds to the order the actions are executed within the model.
