      title="Modeling AspectJ in UML with AspectJ profile">
      <description>
         The MegaM@Rt AspectJ profile can be apply to model aspects and pointcut/jointpoints for software systems modelled with UML. 
         <br/>Following procedure describes how to use the profile in Papyrus UML Editor. 
         <br/>As an example, we use the figure.uml model shipped within the project <b>megamart2-papyrus/Plugins/eu.megamark2.papyrus.profiles.aom/examples</b>. 
         <br/>This figure model is borrowed from AspectJ documentation: <b>https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/next/progguide/printable.html#starting-aspectj</b>

      title="Generating AspectJ code from a model">
      <description>
        The MegaM@RT Acceleo generator plugin supports the automatic generation of AspectJ code from an UML model (made using the megaM@RT AspectJ profile), the generator is installed with the MegaM@RT extensions.
		<br/>
		Generating code is very simple, right click on your .uml file in the Eclipse project explorer, and click on the menu item Acceleo Model to Text >> Generate AspectJ Code.
		<br/>
		After code generation a dialog will inform you about the location of the generated files (usually a src-gen folder into the project folder).
